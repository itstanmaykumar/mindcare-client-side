        "des": "As women age, it’s only a matter of time before menopause sets in. Since every person is unique, the timing of menopause varies from one person to the next. But, generally speaking, menopause affects women, transgender men, and some nonbinary individuals in their late 40s and early 50s. While menopause is a completely natural process, individuals can feel its effects quite differently. For example, some people going through menopause might feel nothing much out of the ordinary while others might feel anxiety and depression. In extreme cases, some women going through menopause can experience a condition called menopausal psychosis. But before we examine the different phases of menopause and how menopause and mental health tie together, let’s take a step back and take a deeper look at what menopause entails."

        "des": "Have you noticed one of your friends is struggling and seems depressed, detached, and generally unhappy? If so, they might be dealing with mental health issues. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, more than one in five U.S. adults experienced mental health issues in 2019. Unsurprisingly, these figures are even higher in the COVID-19 era, as the pandemic threw a wrench into all of our life plans. To illustrate, a recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 41.1 percent of adults were dealing with anxiety or depression in January 2021. If your friend is having a hard time with life, you can take comfort in the fact that they’re by no means alone. By encouraging your friend to think about getting mental health help, you can put them on a path that leads to conquering these issues — helping them live their best life along the way. "
