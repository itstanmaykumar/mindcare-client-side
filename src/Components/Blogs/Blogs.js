            <p>This Mental Health Awareness Month, GoodTherapy seeks to emphasize that mental health is a human experience. Symptoms and circumstances of mental health concerns come in nearly unlimited variation. But they are, above all, a normal part of being alive. We must care for not only our bodies, but also our emotions and thoughts. We have gathered here a selection of quotes about mental health. These are encouraging words about overcoming obstacles, seeking help, and stopping shame.</p>
